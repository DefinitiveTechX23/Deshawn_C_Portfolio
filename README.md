# 🚀 Deshawn Curtis Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a living showcase of my journey into software development, creative design, and technical problem-solving. This site reflects not just what I’ve learned, but how I think, create, and grow.

## 🧠 About This Project

This portfolio is a front-end web application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It features responsive layouts, immersive visuals, and a modular structure designed for scalability and future expansion.

I created this to:
- Share my story as a developer and designer
- Highlight selected projects and experiments
- Build a foundation for collaboration and community
- Continuously evolve as I learn new tools and techniques
